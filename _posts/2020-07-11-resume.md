Aiming to resume writing regularly here. It seems I was pretty regular during
the first quarter of 2020 and then suddenly, I slowed down. A lot. Then, as if,
an omnipresent pandemic had taken over the world my posts had almost completely
stopped.
I will make an effort to try and resume this to reignite my writing habits and
therefore, thinking habits. Thanks for the kind notes some of you have sent. I
will try to update more often.
