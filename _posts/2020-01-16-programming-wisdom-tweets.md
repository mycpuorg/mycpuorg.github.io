This is a small collection of tweets and quotes. Obviously, there are a ton of
truly memorable ones uttered by smart and wise people. These are a few I had
kept handy at at some point.

## Paul Graham
Some of these are paraphrased notes I had kept aside when I first read them.
```
How to detect bias. A good way to detect bias is to check if there are any
particular type of candidates who outperform all other candidates. If this is
the case then the process used in selection of candidates is biased against the
candidates of that type.
```

```
To see fashion in your own time, though, requires a conscious effort. Without
time to give you distance, you have to create distance yourself. Instead of
being part of the mob, stand as far away from it as you can and watch what it's
doing. And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being
suppressed. Web filters for children and employees often ban sites containing
pornography, violence, and hate speech. What counts as pornography and violence?
And what, exactly, is "hate speech?" This sounds like a phrase out of 1984.
```

```
Write like you talk. With a formal tone it becomes easy for the reader's
attention to be distracted.
```

```
Don't wait to do the important things, prune bullshit out of the way
constantly. One question to detect bullshit is to keep asking "Will I remember
this in the future?"
```

```
A domain expert who has some far-fetched crazy idea might turn it into something
morethan that. Or  simply, the fact that something far-fetched has even occurred
to the domain expert indicates that it might be one of those plausible yet "out
there " ideas.
```
