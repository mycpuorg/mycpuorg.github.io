Welcome to the [Void Star Podcast Series](http://www.mycpu.org/about-interviews). This episode contains my conversation with Adam Fineberg. Adam is a multi-faceted technologist, in this snippet from our conversation he gives us a peek into his background. We talk about earlier days of Machine Learning which is more of pattern recognition. These are now termed with modern labels like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelliggence, more specifically Collaborative Filtering etc.

Adam worked as the Chief Architect of WebOS in Palm which was a sort of the pre-cursor to the mobile revolution bringing in cool technologies which were perhaps ahead of their time. We look into what worked and a few key lessons. Adam also talks about a few other startups which were ahead of their times.
