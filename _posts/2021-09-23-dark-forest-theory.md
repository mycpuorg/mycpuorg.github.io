I recently discovered [Three-Body Problem Trilogy by Cixin
Liu](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250254493/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_RHBR94G7JBEVEDG98GMW). Yes,
I was living under a rock but can we talked about the books just for a minute? I
mean, `COME ON!`

If you have not read the books and plan to do so then stop reading here and
once you have done so (at least until the second half of the second book).

I had goosebumps just pacing throug the first book, I have started the second
book but somehow it's a little slower and less clearer than the first so
far. I'm still in the first 10% of the second book or so at the time of this
post. BTW, what a character "Da Shi" is!

I don't know at which point I came across `The Dark Forest Theory`:
```plaintext
The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds another life—another hunter, angel, or a demon, a delicate infant to tottering old man, a fairy or demigod—there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them.
```

Think about that!

There's also a skull-numbing yet amazingly detailed and riveting description of
something called the `Sophon` aka "the smart particle". If you are the types who
reads any tech blogs like you are right now, a mediocre application of Baye's
theorem gives a high likelihood of you loving these books.
