Is today's average software developer equivalent of the automotive industry
worker from the 60's [^1]? This is a thought I have had for a while. In terms of
opportunity, very likely that we are in the middle of a massive spike in jobs
for software development. As the industry matures, I think there are a ton of
jobs increasingly becoming less applicable, in many cases, totally
irrelevant. There were positions where people were solely responsible for
feeding punch cards into massive computers. These have completely vanished. That
was an extreme case because such jobs have been irrelevant for over 30
years. Positions for IT expert which was so rampantly available are fast
disappearing thanks to the widespread preference of cloud based services to
having the headache in-house [^2].

This is true as a general rule for jobs that do not bring value in today's
industry. However, it would have been nearly impossible for a young fresh grad
feeding punch cards into the massive machine to imagine that this machine would
fit in their handbag by the time their children went to middle school. By
extension, this will truer in the future. There's nothing that is convincingly
evident of its permanence or longevity from today's perspective. To try and
guess what sort of jobs that lose relevance we will need to list all the roles
and responsibilities. Further, I will try and stick to job roles that are close
to tech skills instead of roles that are not specific to tech industry ex:
janitor, chef, barista etc.

With an infusion of intelligence into more software related domains, I think
programming is the final frontier. Code writing Code, will be the final nail in
the coffin of traditional jobs as we know today. However, the future is not all
gloomy. Who would have thought Data Scientist would be such a high paying
job today! Or niche domains like: audio editing outside of the film and broadcast
industry would be a thing. So as long people are willing to [pick up new
skills](http://www.mycpu.org/thoughts-about-sw-dev/) it may not be such a big
deal. As Naval Ravikant said, if we are automating away all the boring
jobs then there will be room only for interesting and artistic jobs in the
future which is better for people. Perhaps this includes programming to solve
actual hard problems without the worry of having to get it to actually work and
be useful? ...


[^1]: Assuming this was when jobs were aplenty in the automotive industry, in America.
[^2]: You can argue these positions are still relevant with Cloud providers in
    Data Centers which is true but they are increasingly looking like
    traditional software development positions.
