[Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/) is a tiling window manager that provides
can be configured to suit your needs. It is targeted towards people who care
about this sort of thing. You would one of these people if you like to stick to
keyboard without switching to mouse for basic navigation.

I have tried a couple of other equivalent tiling window managers such as i3
(which uses vim-like key binding), stumpwm was alright but never got into it.

Awesome also provides a whole bunch of widgets/apps out of the box.
