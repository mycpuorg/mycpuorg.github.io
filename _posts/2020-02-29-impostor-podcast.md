This is an experimental episode that I have been meaning to try.

In an [earlier post](http://www.mycpu.org/impostor-syndrome/), I wrote about how
impostor syndrome might be an outlet for a few people who are not ready to make
the jump and learn something new (at times, myself included). This is the audio
form the article, I have found it convenient to listen to long articles. While
this specific one is a short read I want to gauge whether people find this
useful at all.
