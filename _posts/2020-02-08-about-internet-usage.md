So... I'm going to play [``Captain
Obvious``](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=captain+obvious&t=canonical&atb=v135-1&ia=web)
today and say things about Internet usage that might be painfully true. But I
will try to supplement this with some visual representation of data [^1]. I
find it very powerful to visualize some of the statistics which I had taken for
granted about Internet usage and what that means for startups, policy makers
etc.

## History of Information or Books
After the failure of his [early entrepreneurial
adventures](http://aca.st/aecb9c), Johannes Gutenberg invented the [printing
press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg#Early_life). This was
somewhere close to the year 1450. Since then the growth of humankind has
exploded. Ideas could now be communicated faster than ever before. People who
were *(a)* able to read *(b)* allowed to read *(c)* had access to read were
effectively the powerful. [^4]

As you would predict, given that invention of Gutenberg's press happened in
Germany the publishing of books happened to the highest around central Europe
even in the first half of 1500s

Even as late as the __17th century__ the spread and active publishing of new
book titles was limited to central Europe and a handful of colonies in South
America and Japan.

### Enter Uncle Sam
Around the late 18th century, __Cue Dramatic Grunge Guitar Solo___ after the
entry of USA into the scene somehow the spread of the number of new titles
seemed to increase. I'm not sure if this was a coincidence or not but ``Thank
You, Ben Franklin!``.

I digress.

In the new age, the Internet is the agency of information. This is what makes
humans look super to an alien who's monitoring us (like, right now!) Apart from
being the medium of information of the present and the future, it's also an
implicit analog for technology in general. Adoption of Internet is strongly
correlateable to adoption of technology en masse.

So let's focus on Internet now.

## Internet Usage in USA
If we consider a few tens of millions as a critical mass when the scales start
to tip in the favor of labeling a technology as "powerful" then the Internet
started to become so by mid 90's.

### The Virus of the 1999-2000
At least, that's how most well-meaning parents of teenagers who spent all
their nights on the Internet viewed it. Around the year 2000, the spread of
Internet was spreading 
![Internet by 2000](/images/internet_adoption/number-of-internet-users-by-country_2000.png)

<!-- style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe> -->

But because of the decentralized nature of information spread with the Internet
this gave any country willing to adopt it see dizzying rates of growth,
therefore, impact.

### The Great Wall
China was already making ground fast. It was catching up with the rest of the
western world. This was posing a serious challenge to the global impact it's
economy could have.

<!-- <iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-internet-users-by-country?year=2000&time=1990..2016&country=USA" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe> -->

By the year 2007 China was already in the same bracket of Internet
consumption as the US. Due to the withdrawal of Google, Facebook and other
powerful players China still seemed like it was behind its own NAT/Firewall.

### Enter The Ancient Subcontinent
__Cue Sitar Music and smell of fresh Garam Masala__ India! What Happened? Mobile
Revolution is what happened there. An absolute explosion in the number of mobile
devices and fast adoption of technology.

Hopefully this pic incites sufficient optimism about the applications of
the Internet. [^5]

### Context About the Rate of Growth
To put the rate of growth of Internet consumption into perspective, here are a
few important countries in this context.

To put this into perspective in terms of the share of the population that "gone
IP" (ugh..isn't it a stupid phrase!):

### "No Country for Old Men"
[^6]
India is young democracy and has the potential to learn from the errors and
mistakes of the mature ones.

<!-- style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe> -->

### Younger By The Year
India is a country full of youth and it's getting younger by the year! ``Age
Dependency Ratio`` is the ratio of the sum of non-working-age populations (15
yrs < non-working-age or non-working-age > 64yrs ) to the working-age population
(15 yrs <= work-age <= 64). Most of the working force of India is its
youth. This ratio has come down from over ``80% in mid 1960s`` to ``about 50% in
2017``. Perhaps, this implies that India's hardest work rate and, therefore, the
fruits of it are yet to come.

## Conclusion
### Attention Entrepreneurs!
India presents one of the biggest opportunities to set a new precedent in
technology's impact. If Internet can be an analog for technology in this era then
India tops the charts as the preferred destination of promise.

### Attention Policy Makers!
India presents one of the biggest opportunities to set a new precedent in
technology's impact. Let's not muddle this with politicking and defecating on
its potential.
