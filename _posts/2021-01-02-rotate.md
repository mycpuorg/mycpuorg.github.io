Earlier, I had written about ``std::rotate`` and how it can be used to implement
other useful algos.
But how do we implement `std::rotate` itself?

In [this
book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321942043/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_zOw8FbTZ84J0A),
Stepanov and Rose talk about different ways to implement this algorithm. One of
them is the Gries-Mills algorithms that's based on swapping ranges.
A clever alternative (also simpler to implement is the one that employs
reversal).

Turns out, the standard library has both implementations and switches the
impl based on the iterator passed to the algorithm. The swapping version which
roughly goes like:

## Block Swap
```cpp
_RandomAccessIterator __p = __first;
_RandomAccessIterator __ret = __first + (__last - __middle);
for (;;) {
    _RandomAccessIterator __q = __p + __k;
    for (_Distance __i = 0; __i < __n - __k; ++ __i) {
        std::iter_swap(__p, __q);
        ++__p;
        ++__q;
    }
    __n %= __k;
    if (__n == 0)
        return __ret;
    std::swap(__n, __k);
    __k = __n - __k;
}
```


## Reversal
```cpp
std::__reverse(__first,  __middle, bidirectional_iterator_tag());
std::__reverse(__middle, __last,   bidirectional_iterator_tag());

// following is the spiritual equivalent of reverse(first, last)
while (__first != __middle && __middle != __last) {
    std::iter_swap(__first, --__last);
    ++__first;
}
```
