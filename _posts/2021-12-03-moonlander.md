I have been using the moonlander keyboard to boost my productivity. However, it
has annoyed me for the good part of the last couple of months now.

What gets me
is the columnar keyboard layout which means I must unlearn whatever little
muscle memory I had picked up over years of typing on a QWERTY keyboard
layouts. Don't get me wrong, this is stil QWERTY layout or whatever layout you
want it to be but it just feels weirder than anything else out there.

The one big aspect  that stands out is that definitely keeps you on your
toes. If you use a [powerful editor which can change the world in a single
keystroke](http://www.mycpu.org/emacs-productivity-setup/) then you've got to be
doubly,  triply careful before pressing a key.

Maybe, I am still getting used to it but some of the quirks you have with your
keystrokes become apparent when you switch to this keyboard. In effect, what I
have done is tried to customize the keyboard to how it was with my previous
versions.
