We all know that software engineer whom we can never match in their ability of
think of the right abstractions, ability to debug issues quickly and come up
with patches before you reach your desk from theirs. You feel like you missed
the meeting where they handed these *super powers*.

#### Impostor Syndrome, a valuable skill [^1]
Wikipedia defines it as
```
... a psychological pattern in which one doubts one's accomplishments and has a
persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".
```

If you encounter sufficient number of people with the said *super powers*, you
begin to wonder if this whole Impostor Syndrome business is just a syndrome or
is there truth to it. As I have
[written](http://www.mycpu.org/evolution-tech-jobs/) before, the current state
of industry requires a ton of software development work to be done. A sizable
chunk of this work does not demand the highest standard. So there is a lot of
room for low quality. So it is very likely that a large share of engineers are
getting away with sub-par efforts. A lot of the times, this does not have
an impact on the outcome of the product or your company's fate.

### "We ~~Don't~~ Only Hire The Best"
OK, the hiring department will tell you that we only hire the best. It is true
in a few companies. But the HR teams that are under this illusion in other
companies - where are all the average and (!!) below average developers of the
world? They are probably sitting next to you hiding behind some fancy
earphones.

### Getting To My Point?
I sound cynical, but I have something positive to offer. My point was not to say
that all others are low quality. I'm trying to say that a majority of the
people in the industry have a few strengths and a large number of
weaknesses. But invoking patterns like Impostor Syndrome as a general rule only
gives people who are below the bar an excuse to convince themselves that it is
common to not be at your best. If every opportunity at a workplace is treated
like you'd treat an exam in school that counts towards your graduation then the
overall quality of the output seen in the industry would be much higher.

Impostor Syndrome can be a valuable skill. Unfortunately, in its current form,
it democratizes pretense. It can be used as a stepping stone to learn a new
skill-set instead.

[^1]: Obviously, there are people who might be suffering from chronic cases of
    self-doubt, lower endorphins etc. This is not about them, this is about the
    average person. I'd say being brutally honest with yourself is a good and
    necessary first step.
