Over this Jolly Quarantine season, I grabbed a bunch of coffees and watched a
few talks. If you have followed this blog regularly you would have noticed that
of late, I have done this very often. This talk caught my eye because C++-20 is
either unnecessarily awesome or it's heading to become the next Java (whatever
that means). You decide.
