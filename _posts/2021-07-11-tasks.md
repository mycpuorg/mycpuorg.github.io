I am experimenting with different tasking systems to meet a certain need for my
current project. The requirements themselves are nothing unusual to expect from
a tasking system. The only significant piece of this requirement is that the we
have to chain the results from a preceding task and feed it as an input to a new
task. This post may not actually address/implement this requirement but I will
simply log my experience with a tasking system I experimented with.

[Taskflow](https://taskflow.github.io/taskflow/) is an open source library which
"...helps you quickly write parallel and heterogeneous task programs...". What
caught me by surprise is the composition of tasks that this framework allows
for. Consider the following code taken from the examples:

```c++
  // f4: f3_module_task -> f2_module_task
  tf::Taskflow f4; 
  f4.name("F4");
  auto f3_module_task = f4.composed_of(f3);
  auto f2_module_task = f4.composed_of(f2);
  f3_module_task.precede(f2_module_task);
```

Effectively, `f4` is a `taskflow` which is composed of a couple of other similar
`taskflow` objects `f2` and `f3`. Additionally, `f3` precedes `f2`.

Further, `f2` and `f3` are themselves composed of other `taskflow` objects and
so on.

It is easier to visualize this hierarchy and to do this `taskflow` supports
dumping `dotviz` code to an output stream such as `stdout`. To achieve this you
can simply dump as shown:

```c++
f4.dump(std::cout);
```

The examples also show 

```c++
  executor.run_until(
    f4, 
    [iter = 1] () mutable { std::cout << '\n'; return iter-- == 0; }, 
    [](){ std::cout << "First run_until finished\n"; }
  ).get();

  executor.run_until(
    f4, 
    [iter = 2] () mutable { std::cout << '\n'; return iter-- == 0; }, 
    [](){ std::cout << "Second run_until finished\n"; }
  );

  executor.run_until(
    f4, 
    [iter = 3] () mutable { std::cout << '\n'; return iter-- == 0; }, 
    [](){ std::cout << "Third run_until finished\n"; }
  ).get();
```
