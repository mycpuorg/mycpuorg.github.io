I have constantly wondered how top achievers in tech, especially, people who have proven track record of being excellent at say coding and developing huge open projects. Are they gifted people with extra-terrestrial abilities or are they mere mortals who share several drawbacks with the rest of us but do just enough things right, consistently.
Earlier this year I set myself to start a podcast series where I would talk to top class achievers in tech and take a peek at the secrets to their excellence.

The interview format is the following:
It's mostly an informal conversation with the guest that I have for anywhere between 45 minutes to 90 minutes. If it's much longer I will split the episode into smaller chunks.

My aim is to have a podcast that you could play on your commute and come out of it learning a new trick or being motivated, inspired to do a little bit more with your day.

I have learned that getting the audio at the right levels without blowing out ears, yet, getting that 'podcast quality' in a simple audio recording of a conversation can be quite tough.
