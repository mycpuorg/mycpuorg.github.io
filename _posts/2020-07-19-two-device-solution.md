In [earlier post](http://www.mycpu.org/scheduling/), I wrote about productivity
tricks that can be used to schedule tasks in a project to be more effective. It
was a little more formal in its approach since it relied on applying proofs of
algorithms. In the post-pandemic, WFH era, any number of these tricks can be
helpful. Even when any single trick won't last it is worth cycling through
different ones to see which applies best.

Today, I came across an article that recommended a simple rule to
trick myself to separate work from life. Refer to the original article
[here](https://seths.blog/2011/03/are-you-making-something/).

## Two Devices:
The idea is to use two separate devices one strictly meant for work and other
meant for whatever else. Use your desktop/laptop for work. The only rule is,
don't use this for **anything** other than work, you probably own a
phone/reader/tablet/TV to read, watch videos etc. Keep it that way, do not
install anything work related on that unless you are required by the employer to
do so.

This will force you to use the work setup with a mindset of going to work. This
has other advantages of calming the monkey brain from jumping all over. Of
course enjoy your binge-watching/-reading, sports guilt-free.

When you spend too long on one of them I know it is time to switch to the other.
