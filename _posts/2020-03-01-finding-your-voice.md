This is an experimental episode that I have been meaning to try.

In an [earlier post](http://www.mycpu.org/voice-in-writing/), I wrote about
finding your voice in writing. A common pattern to writing successfully. This is
the audio form the article, I have found it convenient to listen to long
articles. While this specific one is a short read I want to gauge whether people
find this useful at all.
