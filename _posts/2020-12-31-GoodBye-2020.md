For those of us lucky enough to be healthy and have no immediate impact from the
pandemic, 2020 reminded us what's important in life and how societies,
economies, and the world, as a whole, can be made to work according to these
priorities.

As I mentioned in an [earlier post](http://www.mycpu.org/scheduling/), there are
ways to make the year work in predictable ways that will turn out to be more
fruitful.

GoodBye 2020! Hello 2021, we are stronger, wiser!

Note: The definition of year-end is an arbitrary line in sand for all of
us, in a cosmic sense, but it's ring of the same bell that we hear around the
world.
