If choose to live in a place with better opportunities for your skill set, it is
likely that renting or buying a place in that area is expensive. Ex: if you are
software professional, living in the San Francisco/Bay Area is expensive. If you
in the Finance Industry, Manhattan or Chicago are expensive cities to live in.

You often have to choose between renting in an area that's plush with people
thriving in their industry or an area with the traditional "blue collar"
workers which is a tad less expensive.

Another way to ask the same question is:
``Am I signing up for a life devoid of social interactions?``
And this is often the case with people who choose to live far from the
epicenters of these hubs.

The density of people living in these hubs apparently has an impact on your
economic well-being than meetss the eye.

### Berlin Wall Example
![Berlin Wall](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/11/berlin-land-prices-Ahlfeldt-etal-2015.png)


Below is an excerpt from the [article](https://ourworldindata.org/personal-relations-econ-outcomes)
```
The map on the left shows that in 1936 there are two areas with very high land values in West Berlin and both are close to the center (they are both part of a concentric ring around the pre-war central business district, located in the middle).

In 1986, we see smaller peak values; in fact, we see that the pre-war peak closest to the Wall is entirely eliminated following division, as this area ceased to be an important center of commercial and retail activity. 

Finally, in 2006, we see again higher peaks; and we see that the area closest to the Wall is reemerging as a center of high land values. 

This evolution is a great example of the economics of density: The areas in West Berlin close to the old central business district became less productive during the division but regained their productivity and attractiveness again soon after reunification. 

Knowledge, public resources, and opportunities for trade and collaboration that had been inaccessible for decades, suddenly became available after the fall of the Wall.6

The importance of personal relations for economic outcomes

```

## Conclusion
Social Connections impact the economic statuses of people to a greater extent
thatn we assume. This is true for cases where personal connections are made even
without a goal to turn into any entreprenurial/economic ambition.
