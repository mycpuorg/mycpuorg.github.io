At some point last year, I had taken some notes refresh minimal amounts of
linear algebra to dive into traditional ``Machine Learning``. Earlier this week,
I risked losing all my notes. No, it was not a backup that was deleted, it was
the main notes. Unforunately, I prefer taking physical notes which were on the
verge of being trashed. So, I have decided to embarass myself and post them
publicly until I get around to translating them into a traditional post.
