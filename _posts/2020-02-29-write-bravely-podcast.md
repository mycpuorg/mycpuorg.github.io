This is an experimental episode that I have been meaning to try.

In an [earlier post](http://www.mycpu.org/tata-2019/), I wrote about writing
bravely. It is something that I had struggled with particularly in the
past. This is the audio form the article, I have found it convenient to listen
to long articles. While this specific one is a short read I want to gauge
whether people find this useful at all.
