To take my mind away from all the [depressing things out
there](http://www.mycpu.org/cdc-jhu-who-covid-19/) I am actively making a choice
to read today.

Like most people in my field, I end up reading a lot of non-fiction and
technical books often. Occasionally, I make a conscious choice to pick up a
fiction book and I cannot put it down. One of the few authors that can I hold
anyone's attention is Neil Gaiman.

Here are his best stuff (Obvious Ones):
[Good Omens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054LJGWS/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_fLzDEbVATH1F8)
[American Gods](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005745I4C/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_pHzDEbA7HAYD7)
[Graveyard Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0011UJM48/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_0MzDEbKC0XG9A)
[Ocean At The End Of The Lane](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009NFHF0Q/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_7LzDEbHGQNKS6)

Now I'm planning to pick up:
[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RKXNDU/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_fPzDEb95B70Y1)
