I came across this talk which I found to be very interesting. I am surveying for
options in this field for a new project whose ideal environment would be to use
a more standard C++ that caters to hardware accelerators such as the Nvidia GPU,
OpenCL accelerators. I have only found the following so far:
+ [Nvidia's HPC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk) C++ Compiler (Originally PGI Compiler)
+ [hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL) - A SYCL Implementation for
CPUs, GPUs
+ [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos) - A Performant Programming
  Model/Eco-system for HPC
+ [OpenACC](https://developer.nvidia.com/OPENacc) - A Compiler directive based
  high performant programming model
+ [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/) - A heterogeneous programming model for
  OpenCL devices.
+ [CUDA C/C++ Extension](https://developer.nvidia.com/Cuda-Toolkit)
+ [OpenCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl)
