Over the last couple of days a movement was started in a tweet to
address the pay inequality in tech, especially for underrepresented groups like
women and minorities. It proposes that everyone tweet out their pay to help
achieve equal pay in tech.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pay inequality is a big problem in tech, especially for underrepresented groups like women and minorities. The best way you can help is by sharing yours.

I absolutely support the idea that for a given role/responsibility if there's
any version of pay dispairty between two people because of their gender or
social/cultural background it must be addressed immediately by the employer and
the industry. If you are deciding not to pay people solely based on their output /
work produced but by their physical, social, cultural, or ethnic attributes it
is objectively wrong, if it is not already illegal. If you are this employer,
Shame On You!

However, I'm not sure about the methods adopted to address this problem here. I
don't know what sort of risks the people who are publicly tweeting their annual
salaries are taking up. Most of tech industry tends to enjoy a healthier pay
standard compared to other hardworking industries. It's one thing if you are
making anywhere in the "average" ballpark. But there are some truly eye-popping
numbers that people are putting out there right next to their mugshots. I might
sound cynical here but I'm not entirely certain this is a smart move.

Let me be clear, I don't have a solution to the problem of pay inequality. What
I also lack is the belief that putting out a number without any context other
than ``YOE``, employer name, and position is helpful. "Software Developer" can be
used to describe a Regular Joe Programmer and people like [Fabrice
Bellard](https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/fabrice-bellard-portrait-of-a-super-productive-pro/),
[GKH](http://www.mycpu.org/interview-with-GKH/), [Steve
Rostedt](http://www.mycpu.org/interview-with-Steve-Rostedt/) etc.

At best, this move reiterates the numbers seen on anonymized forums like
http://www.teamblind.com or Glassdoor, because a profile pic isn't helping in
any way here. In most cases, this is pandering to the Reality TV Soap Opera
audience of the tech world. At worst, it rubs salt in the wounds of people who
are already trying to find ways to make equal pay as their lateral peers. I have
a sneaky suspicion that it also puts the tweeter at some sort of risk. I have
not figured out how just yet , but I got this feeling and can't let go! In
reality, there may not be an easy and scalable way for people to digest all the
context from various people even if it was some how put out.

Let's take an extreme example, If Jeff Dean tweeted about what's surely bound to be
handsome and a well-deserved pay package, I don't see how an underpaid woman / a
person of color can draw meaningful utility from such numbers. An uninformed
reader might simply see a stereotype. If anything, this will reaffirm their
confirmation bias, thus making this whole movement counter-productive. In Jeff's
case, it is unlikely that a tweet that can do justice to the impact he has had on his
employer's bottom line.

Instead of (or at least, in addition to!) putting your numbers out, I think the
well meaning people should give out useful tips that they have applied in real
life. Maybe, each person who is ready to share their Total Comp could share a
salary neogitation tactic that has worked for them in the past or maybe share an
easy skill that super-charged their career. Share your secrets, tricks, hacks
that have gotten you to the fortunate position you are in, than simply brandishing
the fruits of those works, albeit with good intentions.

### Salary Negotiation Tip:
In many states in the US, it is illegal for a prospective employer to ask any
version of, "how much do you currently make?"
During that *"Congratulations! Great News!"* phone call with the recruiter,
anticipate this question. Politely decline to respond. If anything, preempt the
recruiter by asking for salary range for the position in the very first call. It
doesn't make you look "greedy" and if a recruiter tries to make you feel guilty
you could respond with some version of "I'm certain employer XYZ wants to do
everything they can to make sure their prospective employees are treated fairly
in all respects".
