I'm just keeping this here to remind myself that ``std::move()`` doesn't have to
be complex, mind-numbing activity.

Here's [Herb Sutter's post](https://herbsutter.com/2020/02/17/move-simply/) on
getting away with minimal, necessary understanding of ``move`` semantics to not
be afraid of it.

```
"In C++, copying or moving from an object a to an object b sets b to a’s
original value.
The only difference is that copying from a won’t change a, but moving from a
might.

To pass a named object a as an argument to a && “move” parameter (rvalue
reference parameter), write std::move(a). That’s pretty much the only time you
should write std::move, because C++ already uses move automatically when copying
from an object it knows will never be used again, such as a temporary object or
a local variable being returned or thrown from a function.

That’s it."
```

Interestingly enough, there is a page or two's worth of "advanced"
explanation. Then, several pages worth FAQ style explanation. Herb Sutter is the
secretary or chair of C++ standards committee. His job requires him to
understand all the details of the language implementation, but, do I? Am I
simply learning the flaw of a draconian language struggling to keep pace with
the sleeker, yuppier, new-age competitors?
