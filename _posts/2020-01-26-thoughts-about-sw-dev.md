This is not a technical topic although the lesson can apply anywhere. There is
nothing terribly new in this post. I'd be shocked if I'm the first person to
come up with this points in this essay. OK, with that said, I hope I can live to
adopt this lesson and be even remotely successful in applying it to my life.
```

Learning a complex topic deeply is tied to the ability and practice of
correlating the topic with prior knowledge at fundamental levels. This sounds
sexy, but you won't get to this point without tackling some uncomfortable
problems in the beginning. Doing so, is what let you build the prior knowledge
in the first place. The problem of dealing with a new topic is uncomfortable
because its nuances are unfamiliar to us. We can't draw on any prior experience
to tackle them, yet.

Well trained software developers, engineers (non-software disciplines),
builders, creators in other areas often tend to keep their cards too close to
their chests. We could argue that well trained people of these domains are
experts in consistently building things that work. By avoiding the risks that
can result in failures. By definition, this could mean things built by well
trained domain experts don't fail. In the most common form, experts are people
who can navigate both the studied and unfamiliar waters well enough to build a
successful project in the domain. By definition, experts will stay away from
making unusual choices that have no signs of success based on prior art. This is
what experts are paid for. Ironically, this is *not* how their expertise was
built.

If no one starts out being an expert, then they must have failed their way (at
least in small enough doses to stay afloat) to get to where they are. Now, failures
through proxy where you learn through the failures of others does not count
because this would imply you still relied on failures to actually learn the
lessons. Besides, your mentors/teachers can't and don't always fail on behalf of
their students to be able to teach. Becoming an expert in anything worthwhile is
not easy. If expertise can be conveyed through words, there would be many who
would have done it easily, thereby, changing who we would call an expert.

However, the conscientious folks who put in the effort and hard work tend to
become experts in their niche roughly after a certain amount of time spent in
their domain. Therefore, by definition, there exists an optimal number of
failures after which you can call yourself an expert. The catch is that, you
have a ceiling function with a limit on the number of failures you can
experience *after* you have this "status" before you are no longer regarded an
expert. In real world, this translates to situations like a successful movie
star can have only a small string of flops before they are written off, a
successful sportsperson can go only for so many games/tournaments without
achieving success before they are removed from consideration for Prime Time,
etc.

The trend is that if every player is well meaning and tries to increase their
base levels by diligently working towards this common goal of achieving
expertise then your expertise today is tomorrow's common practice (or "best
practice" at best).

Following this trail of thought, expertise can be loosely defined as a mental
state among people with a certain number of failures in the past that is
considered optimal by current standards. The current standards is an ever
changing parameter. The burden of expertise will stop you from failing further,
therefore, feeling like an "expert" is sub-optimal at best, stasis at worst.

The best antidote to this is to simply put your mind in a state where you
internalize that falling back on your "expertise" for anything other than
remembering the lessons from previous failures is a strict NO. Without this you
will lose the "expertise". The other benefit from thinking so, is it keeps you
humble enough that you can look at new problems with an open mind. If the
problem fits a pattern, great!, apply it and move on. If it doesn't, then you
have another pattern to learn and use in future. Usually, such patterns tend to be
omnipresent spanning multiple domains and fields.

In short, once you start feeling comfortable with applying a set of patterns
take up new projects that make you feel slightly less comfortable. Rinse and
Repeat.
